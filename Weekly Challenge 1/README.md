## FizzBuzz
Write a program which prints all the Fizz and Buzzes from 1 to 100. A number is a “Fizz” if it’s divisible by 3, a “Buzz” if it’s divisible by 5, and a “FizzBuzz” if it’s divisible by both. **Note: Output format doesn’t matter. We use commas here to keep the document compact, but you can print each number in its line.**
### Example Input And Output
```
3 - Fizz, 5 - Buzz, 6 - Fizz, 9 - Fizz, 10 - Buzz, 12 – Fizz, 15 - FizzBuzz
```

## Fibonacci
Write a function fib(n) which returns the nth Fibonacci number. Each Fibonacci number is calculated by adding the two previous Fibonacci numbers, starting with 0 and 1. So, the first 10 Fibonacci terms are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34…
### Example Input and Output
```
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(6) = 8
```

## Fibonacci – Continued
Write a program which sums all the odd Fibonacci numbers from 0 to n. **Tip: Use the previous function you’ve written.**
### Example Input and Output
```
Enter n: 6
0 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 5  = 10
```
